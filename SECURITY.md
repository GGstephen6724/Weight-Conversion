The file should provide clear guidelines on identifying and defining what constitutes a vulnerability within our project or system. It should outline the criteria or characteristics that classify an issue as a vulnerability, including examples or descriptions to aid in understanding.

Additionally, the file should specify a secure and reliable method for reporting vulnerabilities. This could include contact information for designated security personnel or teams, a dedicated email address, or a submission form. It's important that the reporting process ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the reported vulnerabilities, and that it encourages responsible disclosure practices.

Overall, the file should serve as a comprehensive resource for stakeholders to understand, recognize, and report vulnerabilities effectively and securely within our project or system.
